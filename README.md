# AUDIO-VISUAL-SPEECH-RECOGNITION
Audio visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a technique that uses image processing capabilities in lip reading to aid speech recognition systems in recognizing undeterministic phones or giving preponderance among near probability decisions.
The main aim of this project is to develop " Audio Visual Speech Recognition using deep learning" in such a way that it can be helpful for people who deal with speech impairments.
