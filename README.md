# AUDIO-VISUAL-SPEECH-RECOGNITION
Audio visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a technique that uses image processing capabilities in lip reading to aid speech recognition systems in recognizing indeterministic phones or giving preponderance among near probability decisions.

Each system of lip reading and speech recognition works separately, then their results are mixed at the stage of feature fusion. As the name suggests, it has two parts. First one is the audio part and second one is the visual part.

The main objectives of our project are to implement

•	An Assistive technology on speech-to-text conversion.

•	Lip reading architecture to capture visual speech recognition 

•	Speaker recognition under noisy and unconstrained conditions

In our work we’ve experimented with different methods to implement the audio-visual recognition. 
One way which we’ve tried is to recognize phrases and sentences being spoken in a video and display in a text file. 
We’ve successfully implemented the speech to text conversion where the system is able to recognize the sentences spoken by the speaker even in noisy and unconstrained conditions to some extent.
